# 📝 Tele_Ophthalmology Project Progress Report

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is focused on building a deep learning pipeline for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) classification using retina images. The workflow is based on the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `src/preprocess.py`: Preprocessing and visualization of retina images.
- `src/train_model.py`: Full PyTorch training pipeline for DR classification.
- `data/aptos2019-blindness-detection/`: Contains `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and all retina images.

---

## 🛠️ Features & Steps Completed

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and visualized retina images with labels using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
- Checked image loading and basic preprocessing (resize, normalization).

### 2️⃣ PyTorch Dataset & DataLoader
- Created a custom `FundusDataset` class to load images and labels from a DataFrame.
- Used `train_test_split` to create training and validation sets (stratified by class).
- Built separate DataLoaders for training and validation.

### 3️⃣ Model Building & Training
- Used a pretrained ResNet18 model from torchvision.
- Modified the final layer to output 5 classes (for DR stages 0-4).
- Defined loss (`CrossEntropyLoss`) and optimizer (`Adam`).
- Implemented a training loop with:
  - Real-time progress bars for both training and validation (using `tqdm`)
  - Live printing of loss and accuracy for both train and validation sets after each epoch

### 4️⃣ Checkpointing & Resume Training
- Added automatic checkpoint saving: 💾
  - The model is saved as `best_model_checkpoint.pth` whenever validation loss improves.
- Added resume logic: ✅
  - If a checkpoint exists, training resumes from the next epoch.
  - If not, training starts fresh.

### 5️⃣ User Experience
- Progress bars show live batch/epoch progress and estimated time per batch.
- All warnings and status messages are clearly printed.
- Training can be safely stopped and resumed at any time without losing progress.

---

## 🌟 Current Capabilities
- End-to-end DR classifier training with validation and checkpointing.
- Robust to interruptions (safe resume).
- Modern, readable, and modular code structure.

---

## 📝 Next Steps (Suggestions)
- Add test set prediction and submission file generation.
- Implement data augmentation for better generalization.
- Add early stopping or learning rate scheduling.
- Visualize training/validation loss and accuracy curves.

---

## 🎉 Summary
You have a fully working, robust, and user-friendly deep learning pipeline for DR classification, with all essential features for experimentation and further development!
